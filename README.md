This mini project is based on django web application which is a Movie Recommendation System.

        Basically, it makes use of collaborative filtering and provides each user their recommended 
        movies based upon the ratings given by them to each movie.

        At the backend, admin has the access to add new movies and alter details of movies.

Some Python Dependencies Used:

        1. requests
        2. bs4
        3. numpy
        4. django

A great use of web scraping using Beautiful Soup is also done in this project where a python 
script was written to extract movie details from IMDB's website for each genre.

The extracted details were saved into an excel file which was later imported into the SQLite database.
